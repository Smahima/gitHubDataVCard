Project 7 August 2017, updated github on 14 & 15 October 2017
- Using github API to create a vcard with my profile info
- Creating without starter files.
- Function to json github API uses template literal to render the items from gh profile.


Still left to do:
a. Basics: need to format links to github and linkedin
b. Profile picture is not in correct location, but fixed to be circular instead of square.
c. Columns still need to be formatted better
